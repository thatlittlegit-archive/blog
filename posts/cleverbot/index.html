		<p>Hey!</p>

<p>Recently had an interesting conversation with Cleverbot. I
said &lsquo;ok&rsquo; repeatedly (so much that the page told me to say
something new, so I changed punctuation, thus the change from
&lsquo;Ok.&rsquo; to &lsquo;Ok!&rsquo;), and it started talking about Minecraft and
Call Me Maybe. The script is below, <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/rvQtvDrp">and also in a Pastebin</a>.</p>

<pre><code>User: Hello.
